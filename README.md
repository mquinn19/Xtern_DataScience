# Xtern_DataScience

This repository completes a data analysis of checkin_dataset.csv (the file is there for reference) in Jupyter. 
Within the Jupyter notebook, both Python and R were used to complete the analysis. Due to some unforseen computer
troubles, R was not executed in the notebook, however, the code used to get the output is given along with its corresponding 
output so it can be run on Rstudio. The .png file in this repository is a screenshot of the R output for reference. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider me for the TechPoint Xtern Program. I look forward to hearing form you!
